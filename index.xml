      <description>This is the place to insert some very good tutorials about your projects. Please keep in mind that the average end users wants to be able to install, run and test it in less than 10min on his laptop. This is a very generic way to evaluate a project.
If you have only one tutorial, you can erase the example below. And instead, write it here. If you have many tutorials, why not list them here and create dedicated pages?</description>

      <description>This is where you can write your documentation if you want to do it with Hugo, in markdown. You can then put all the screenshots, graphics and other pictures in the &amp;ldquo;static&amp;rdquo; folder. There is already a &amp;ldquo;help&amp;rdquo; folder too.
Or, you can use a dedicated application to write your documentation, and export it in static HTML. You can then put it in this folder, it will be available when you upload your website on the webserver.</description>
